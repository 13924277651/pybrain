Using Datasets
==============

Datasets are useful for allowing comfortable access to training, test and 
validation data. Instead of having to mangle with arrays, PyBrain gives you a
much more sophisticated datastructure that allows easier work with your data.

For the different tasks that arise in machine learning, there are of course 
different datasets:

* :ref:`superviseddataset`
* :ref:`sequentialdataset`
* :ref:`classificationdataset`

The different types share some common functionality.
